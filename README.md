# 🛡️ My Cybersecurity Research

# 👋 Introduction

Hi, I’m Ritesh Devkatte — a Cybersecurity Researcher, Bug Bounty Hunter, and active CTF (Capture The Flag) player.
I’m currently pursuing my B.Sc. in Cyber & Digital Science (CDS), with a strong passion for finding, reporting, and fixing security vulnerabilities.

This repository documents my learning journey, hands-on experience, and real-world case studies related to web application and network security.


## 📖 About This Project

* Covers cybersecurity theory, common attack types, and detailed prevention techniques.
* Shares my personal ethical hacking experience on testing real-world systems (with permission).
* Includes payload examples, scripts, and code snippets for educational use.
* Aims to spread awareness and strengthen overall application and network security.

# Ethical Use

All information, payloads, and examples in this repository are strictly for educational purposes in authorized environments like DVWA, Juice Shop, or systems where you have explicit permission.
Unauthorized testing is illegal and goes against the principles of ethical hacking.

## 🛠️ My Path into Ethical Hacking & Bug Bounty

Getting started in ethical hacking and bug bounty hunting involves:

1. Learning the basics – Networking, operating systems (Linux/Windows), and web technologies (HTML, JS, HTTP).
2. Studying security fundamentals – Vulnerabilities like XSS, SQLi, CSRF, SSRF, and authentication flaws.
3. Practicing in safe labs – DVWA, Juice Shop, Hack The Box, TryHackMe.
4. Understanding the law – Always get written permission before testing.
5. Joining bug bounty platforms – HackerOne, Bugcrowd, Intigriti, YesWeHack.
6. Reporting responsibly – Write clear, reproducible vulnerability reports with remediation steps.

 
Why I Keep Pushing:
Curiosity fuels my passion to uncover how every system works, because true security is just an illusion.
Keep learning, keep trying, and keep practicing—success comes to those who never give up.
Explore new tools fearlessly, experiment boldly, and unlock the hidden secrets in every line of code.
