# Welcome to My Ethical Hacking Blog...

This blog is my personal space to share my **cybersecurity learning journey** and document my growth as a security researcher.  

I use it as both a learning log and a portfolio — a place where I can look back on what I’ve learned, share insights with others, and track my progress as I move deeper into ethical hacking and bug bounty hunting.

Here’s what you’ll find here:

- **OWASP Top 10** security risks — explained with safe examples and practical prevention methods  
- **Cybersecurity tools** — from beginner-friendly utilities to advanced frameworks (Burp Suite, Nmap, Metasploit, and more)  
- **Networking basics and advanced concepts** applied to security testing  
- My **bug bounty journey** — achievements, challenges, and lessons from real-world authorized targets  
- The strategies I use to find and test vulnerabilities in a safe, responsible way  
- Weekly deep dives into specific tools, techniques, or vulnerability classes  
- Hands-on lab projects and demonstrations that can be replicated without risk

## My Mission
To go beyond theory and build practical, real-world skills in cybersecurity.  
This blog is a record of how I’m growing from the basics into advanced techniques in ethical hacking, vulnerability research, and bug bounty programs.

## My Approach
- Only test within **authorized environments** or approved bug bounty programs  
- Share content that is **safe, legal, and useful** to learners and professionals  
- Focus on the thought process, methodology, and lessons learned from every challenge
