Subdomain Takeover — My Learning Journey

Introduction
Over the last couple of days, I went down the rabbit hole of subdomain takeover vulnerabilities.
I didn’t go hacking on live targets (that would be illegal!), but I did spin up a safe lab to see how these bugs actually happen in the real world.

It was a mix of curiosity, a bit of “what-if” thinking, and the usual late-night obsession that comes with learning something new in security.

What Exactly Is a Subdomain Takeover?
Picture this:

You’ve got a subdomain like blog.example.com.
Instead of hosting it yourself, you point it to an external service via a CNAME record.
That external service account gets deleted or never claimed.
An attacker swoops in, claims it, and now they control content served from your trusted domain.

Why that’s scary:

They can host anything they want (malware, phishing pages, scams).

Users trust the domain, so they’re more likely to fall for it.

Cookies, tokens, and private data can be stolen if the site isn’t locked down.

How I Approached It

Step 1 — Hunting for Subdomains
I played with some popular tools: Subfinder, Amass, Sublist3r, httpx, and passive sources like VirusTotal.

Step 2 — Understanding CNAME Records
A CNAME record is basically a nickname in DNS — it says, “Hey, if you’re looking for this domain, go check that domain instead.”
Example:
blog.example.com → CNAME → myblog.github.io
If myblog.github.io is free for anyone to register, that’s a sitting duck.

Step 3 — Spotting Weak Links
I used Subzy, which checks subdomains against known vulnerable services.
Fed it my list of subdomains.
Matched them with takeover-prone services.
Found one that looked vulnerable — didn’t touch it.

Step 4 — My Safe Lab Experiment (GitHub Pages)
I recreated a takeover in a sandbox:

Created a new GitHub repo.

Added a CNAME file with a target subdomain.

Turned on GitHub Pages.

Saw how easy it would be to capture a subdomain if it pointed to an unclaimed site.

The “Usual Suspects” — Services Often in Bug Reports

GitHub Pages (username.github.io) — Repo deleted → attacker can claim it → host anything under your trusted domain.

Heroku (herokuapp.com) — App deleted → attacker can reuse the name → phishing or scams.

Amazon S3 (s3.amazonaws.com) — Deleted bucket → takeover possible → malicious file hosting or stealing uploads.

AWS CloudFront (cloudfront.net) — Misconfigured or removed → altered content delivery.

Cargo Collective (cargocollective.com) — Abandoned portfolios → fake identity or spam.

Bitbucket (bitbucket.io) — Deleted repos → push fake open-source projects with malware.

Shopify (myshopify.com) — Closed/inactive store → fake e-commerce scams.

Tilda (tilda.ws) — Deleted site → scam landing pages.

Fastly (fastly.net) — Unclaimed CDN endpoint → inject bad scripts.

Pantheon (pantheonsite.io) — Deleted dev/test sites → leak internal content or plant malware.

WordPress VIP (wpcomstaging.com) — Unused staging → leak unreleased content or secrets.

Azure (azurewebsites.net) — Removed web app → phishing or fake login portals.

Surge.sh (surge.sh) — Deleted static deployment → malicious replacement.

Readme.io (readme.io) — Deleted docs → fake guides.

Help Scout (helpscoutdocs.com) — Deleted support docs → mislead customers or collect sensitive info.

Unbounce (unbouncepages.com) — Removed landing page → phishing disguised as real pages.

My Go-To Learning Resources

Big Takeaways

Audit your DNS records — old CNAMEs are silent time bombs.

Kill or update DNS entries when deleting services.

Automate checks — attackers can wait years.

Always get permission before testing anything live.

Final Note
This is for educational purposes only.
No live systems were touched, no rules were broken. Just me, my lab, and a lot of coffee.
