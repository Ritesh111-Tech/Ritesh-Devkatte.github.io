# 🔐 API Key Exposure in JavaScript Files — Why It Matters & How I Learned to Detect It.

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are the backbone of the modern internet. Almost every application you use — food delivery apps, maps, chats, fintech, streaming — relies on APIs to communicate securely between services.

Because APIs are so powerful, they are usually protected using **API Keys**.
If those keys accidentally get exposed (for example, inside a public JavaScript file), it can lead to **serious financial and security risks** for companies.

This write-up documents my learning journey on:

* what APIs are
* why API keys matter
* how services like Google Maps API work
* how API leaks happen
* and how I tested tools in Kali Linux to detect exposed keys responsibly

> ⚠️ **Educational Purpose Only**
> My intention is to understand security risks so developers can fix them — NOT to misuse exposed keys.


## 🧠 What Is an API & Why Is It Important?

An **API (Application Programming Interface)** allows two software systems to talk to each other.

Common real-world examples:

* Google Maps API → Track delivery locations
* Payment APIs → Online transactions
* ChatGPT API → AI features in apps
* Email APIs → OTPs & notifications

Without APIs, apps would not be able to exchange data or perform online services.


## ⚙️ How Does an API Key Work?

Most APIs require a **secret API key** to authenticate requests.

Think of an API key as
👉 **a password used by software to identify itself**

When an app sends a request:

```
User → App → API Server
```

The request contains:

* API key
* Requested data
* App identity

If the key is valid → the API processes the request.

So the API key must always stay **private and secure**.


## 🗺 Example: How Google Maps API Works

Many websites and apps use **Google Maps API** to:

* display maps
* calculate distance
* track delivery drivers
* show live location

### Real-world examples

* Swiggy / Zomato — delivery tracking
* Uber — live route navigation
* Real estate apps — property locations

Developers integrate Google Maps API directly into their app or website.
Each time the API is used, **the company is billed based on usage**.

For example (not exact pricing):

* Google CAPTCHA → around $2
* Google Maps API → around $7 (usage-based)

So if someone steals the API key and uses it heavily:

👉 **the company pays the bill — not the attacker**

This leads to real financial loss.


## ❗ Why API Key Leaks Are Dangerous

If API keys are exposed publicly, attackers may:

* use paid services for free
* abuse billing
* access restricted features
* impersonate legitimate apps

This becomes a **financial + security risk**.

### How API keys leak

* hard-coded in public JavaScript files
* uploaded to public GitHub repos
* left inside debug/test builds
* forgotten during development


## 🔍 My Learning: Detecting API Keys in JavaScript Files

As part of my cybersecurity learning journey, I explored how researchers detect exposed API keys — **ethically and responsibly**.

I used tools in **Kali Linux** to scan public JavaScript files.

---

### 🛠 Tool 1 — Pinkerton (finding JavaScript files)

Pinkerton helps locate JavaScript files used by a website.

#### Install Pinkerton

```
git clone https://github.com/ankane/pinkerton.git
cd pinkerton
bundle install
```

#### Run Pinkerton

```
[pinkerton https://target-website.com]
```

This lists all JavaScript files loaded by the target website.

> **Note:** I only test on legal and authorized targets.

### 🧪 Tool 2 — gmapsapiscanner (Google Maps API key testing)

Once a key is identified, researchers check whether it is:

* active
* restricted
* or misconfigured

#### Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ozguralp/gmapsapiscanner.git
cd gmapsapiscanner
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run

```
python3 gmapsapiscanner.py -k YOUR_API_KEY
```

Results indicate if the key is:

* Safe
* Misconfigured
* Exploitable

## 🛡 Ethical Reminder

I strictly follow:

* I only analyze systems I own or have permission for
* I never exploit vulnerabilities
* I never cause financial loss
* I report issues responsibly

**Security research should protect users and companies — not harm them.**

## 📚 Key Takeaways

* APIs are everywhere
* API keys are sensitive credentials
* Exposed keys can cause financial & security damage
* Developers must always restrict API keys
* Regular security audits are essential.
