### My Ethical Hacking Learning Journey: Understanding the OSI and TCP/IP Models

Hello everyone! I'm back with another step in my ethical hacking journey, and today I’m diving into something foundational for networking in cybersecurity: the OSI and TCP/IP models. In my last post (shared on September 21, 2025), I covered networking basics like IPs, packets, protocols, and Windows commands like ipconfig and ping. Those gave me a starting point, but to really understand how data moves through networks—and where vulnerabilities creep in—I need to grasp these models. The OSI Model is like a theoretical map, while TCP/IP is what actually powers the internet. As someone learning ethical hacking, knowing these helps me pinpoint where attacks (like DDoS or phishing) happen and how to test for them. I’ve been studying from resources like CompTIA Network+ guides and online platforms like TryHackMe, and I’ll break it down in a way that’s clear for beginners like me. Let’s do this!

#### What is the OSI Model?
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a way to break down network communication into seven layers, each handling a specific job. Think of it like a recipe for sending data: each layer adds an ingredient to make sure the message gets from one device to another correctly.

- **Who Created It?**: It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1984. Back in the late 1970s, tech experts wanted a universal way for different systems (like IBM and early PCs) to talk to each other, so they created this standard to ensure compatibility across vendors.

- **Why Is It Theoretical?**: The OSI Model is more of a guide than something you’d build a network with. It’s like a perfect blueprint that’s too detailed for everyday use but great for understanding and troubleshooting. It helps you think about networking step by step, which is super useful when you’re trying to figure out where something—like a security flaw—went wrong.

For ethical hacking, this model is key because it helps me map attacks to specific layers. For example, I can see if a phishing scam targets the top layer or if a network flood hits a lower one.

#### The 7 Layers of the OSI Model
Each layer has a unique role, adding or removing pieces of data (like headers) as it moves from an app on your device to a wire and back. Here’s what each layer does, with examples and why it matters for cybersecurity. I’ll keep it straightforward, like I’m explaining it to a friend. To make it more useful for ethical hacking, I've expanded the cybersecurity section for each layer with threat classification: including common attack methods, specific attack threats, and attack severity (rated low, medium, or high based on potential impact like data loss, system downtime, or widespread compromise).

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**  
   - **What It Does**: This is where you interact with the network—like browsing a website or sending an email. It handles the data your apps create and makes sure it’s ready to send. It also identifies the right recipient and checks if the network is available.
   - **Examples**: Protocols like HTTP (for websites), SMTP (for sending emails), or DNS (for turning domain names into IPs). Think of Chrome or Outlook using these.
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: This is where attacks like phishing, cross-site scripting (XSS), or SQL injection happen. As an ethical hacker, I’d test web apps here for weak logins or unsecure forms.
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Injection (e.g., embedding malicious code), social engineering (e.g., tricking users via emails), or misconfiguration exploitation (e.g., exposed APIs).
       - **Attack Threats**: Phishing (deceptive emails), XSS (script injection in web pages), SQL injection (database manipulation), CSRF (forging requests), directory traversal (accessing unauthorized files).
       - **Attack Severity**: High—often leads to data breaches, account takeovers, or full system compromise, as it directly affects user-facing services.
   - **Bonus on HTTP Status Codes**: Since HTTP is a key protocol here, understanding status codes is crucial for debugging and exploiting web apps. They indicate server responses: 1xx (informational, e.g., 100 Continue), 2xx (success, e.g., 200 OK for successful requests), 3xx (redirection, e.g., 301 Moved Permanently), 4xx (client errors, e.g., 404 Not Found or 403 Forbidden), 5xx (server errors, e.g., 500 Internal Server Error). In hacking, codes like 401 Unauthorized can reveal auth flaws, while 500s might indicate injection vulnerabilities.

2. **Presentation Layer (Layer 6)**  
   - **What It Does**: This layer translates data so the receiving system understands it. It handles things like encryption (securing data), compression (shrinking files), and formatting (like turning text into the right character set).
   - **Examples**: SSL/TLS for secure websites, JPEG for images, or ASCII for text encoding.
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: Weak encryption (like outdated SSL) can expose data here. Hackers might send malformed data to crash an app, so I’d test for proper encryption in pentests.
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Format string attacks (exploiting data parsing), encryption downgrade (forcing weak ciphers), or compression bombs (overloading with zipped data).
       - **Attack Threats**: SSL stripping (downgrading to unencrypted), Heartbleed (memory leaks in OpenSSL), malformed input (causing crashes or overflows).
       - **Attack Severity**: Medium to High—can lead to data exposure or denial of service, especially if encryption fails, allowing interception of sensitive info.

3. **Session Layer (Layer 5)**  
   - **What It Does**: Manages the “conversation” between two apps, setting up, maintaining, and closing connections. It ensures data flows smoothly, like pausing and resuming a download if the connection drops.
   - **Examples**: Protocols like NetBIOS (for Windows sessions) or SIP (for video calls).
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: Session hijacking—like stealing your login session via a cookie—is a big risk here. I’d check for secure session handling, like strong tokens, to prevent this.
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Interception (sniffing session data), replay (reusing captured sessions), or fixation (forcing a known session ID).
       - **Attack Threats**: Session hijacking (stealing cookies), replay attacks (repeating valid sessions), session fixation (pre-setting IDs for victims).
       - **Attack Severity**: High—often results in unauthorized access, data theft, or impersonation, bypassing authentication.

4. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**  
   - **What It Does**: Makes sure data gets delivered reliably, breaking it into chunks (segments) and checking for errors. It uses ports to direct data to the right app and controls the flow to avoid overwhelming the network.
   - **Examples**: TCP (reliable, used for web pages) and UDP (faster, used for streaming).
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: This is where port scanning (with tools like Nmap) happens to find open services. Attacks like SYN floods (a type of DDoS) target this layer, so I’d test firewalls to block them.
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Flooding (overloading with packets), scanning (probing ports), or spoofing (faking source ports).
       - **Attack Threats**: SYN floods (DDoS via half-open connections), UDP floods (amplification attacks), port knocking (hidden access), TCP hijacking (sequence prediction).
       - **Attack Severity**: Medium to High—can cause downtime (DoS) or enable further exploitation, like pivoting through open ports.

5. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**  
   - **What It Does**: Handles routing—figuring out the best path for data across networks. It uses logical addresses (like IPs) and can split data if needed.
   - **Examples**: IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP (used by ping), or routing protocols like OSPF.
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: IP spoofing or messing with routing (like BGP attacks) happens here. I’d use tools like traceroute to map networks and spot weak routers during a pentest.
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Spoofing (faking IPs), redirection (altering routes), or fragmentation (splitting packets maliciously).
       - **Attack Threats**: IP spoofing (hiding attack origins), BGP hijacking (rerouting traffic), ICMP tunneling (hiding data in pings), smurf attacks (amplification via broadcasts).
       - **Attack Severity**: High—can redirect traffic for interception (MITM) or cause large-scale disruptions, like internet outages.

6. **Data Link Layer (Layer 2)**  
   - **What It Does**: Moves data within a single network, using physical addresses (MAC). It packages data into frames, checks for errors, and manages access to the physical medium (like Ethernet cables).
   - **Examples**: Ethernet, ARP (links IPs to MACs), or PPP for dial-up.
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: ARP poisoning (faking MAC addresses) enables man-in-the-middle attacks. I’d test switches or use VLANs to secure this layer.
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Poisoning (corrupting address tables), flooding (overwhelming switches), or eavesdropping (sniffing frames).
       - **Attack Threats**: ARP poisoning (MITM via fake MACs), MAC flooding (CAM table overflow), VLAN hopping (jumping segments).
       - **Attack Severity**: Medium—local network impact, like data interception or DoS on switches, but can escalate to broader breaches.

7. **Physical Layer (Layer 1)**  
   - **What It Does**: Deals with the actual hardware—cables, signals, and connectors. It turns data into electrical or radio signals and sends them over wires or Wi-Fi.
   - **Examples**: Ethernet cables (RJ-45), Wi-Fi (802.11), fiber optics.
   - **Cybersecurity Angle**: Physical attacks like tapping cables or jamming Wi-Fi signals happen here. I’d secure this with locked server rooms or encrypted Wi-Fi (like WPA3).
     - **Threat Classification**:
       - **Attack Methods**: Tampering (physical access), jamming (disrupting signals), or eavesdropping (tapping media).
       - **Attack Threats**: Wiretapping (intercepting cables), evil twin (fake Wi-Fi APs), signal jamming (DoS on wireless).
       - **Attack Severity**: Low to Medium—requires physical proximity, but can lead to data leaks or outages if not secured.

A handy way to remember the layers: “All People Seem To Need Data Processing” (Application to Physical). As data moves down the stack, each layer adds its own wrapper (encapsulation); on the receiving end, it’s unwrapped in reverse.

#### The TCP/IP Model: How It Actually Works
While the OSI Model is a great way to think about networking, the TCP/IP Model is what’s actually used in real life. Developed in the 1970s by the U.S. Department of Defense for ARPANET (the early internet), it’s the practical framework that makes the internet tick.

- **Why Is It Practical?**: Unlike OSI’s rigid layers, TCP/IP was built to work. It’s flexible, scalable, and tied to real protocols (like TCP for reliability or IP for addressing). It’s what your laptop or phone uses to connect to the web.

The TCP/IP Model has four layers (sometimes listed as five), and here’s how they map to OSI:

1. **Application Layer** (Covers OSI Layers 5-7): Handles app-level tasks like browsing or emailing. Protocols: HTTP, FTP, DNS. It does formatting, sessions, and user interaction.
2. **Transport Layer** (OSI Layer 4): Manages end-to-end delivery. Protocols: TCP (reliable), UDP (fast). It handles ports and error checking.
3. **Internet Layer** (OSI Layer 3): Routes data with IPs. Protocols: IP, ICMP, ARP. It’s about getting packets to the right network.
4. **Network Access/Link Layer** (OSI Layers 1-2): Covers hardware and local transmission. Protocols: Ethernet, Wi-Fi. It deals with frames and signals.

(Sometimes a “Host-to-Network” layer is mentioned, but it’s usually part of Network Access.)

**How It Differs from OSI**:
- TCP/IP has fewer layers (4 vs. 7), so it’s simpler.
- OSI is a general guide for any network; TCP/IP is tied to specific protocols used in the internet.
- In hacking, I think in TCP/IP for tools like Wireshark (which captures IP or TCP packets) but use OSI to analyze issues across layers.

#### Why This Matters for Ethical Hacking
Understanding these models lets me see where attacks hit. For example:
- A phishing email exploits the Application layer (OSI Layer 7).
- A DDoS attack floods the Transport layer (OSI Layer 4).
- ARP poisoning messes with the Data Link layer (OSI Layer 2).

This ties back to my earlier post: commands like ping (ICMP, Internet/Network layer) or netstat (ports, Transport layer) make sense in this context. For pentesting, I’d scan each layer—starting with physical security (locked rooms) up to app vulnerabilities (testing web forms).

I’m practicing this in virtual labs like TryHackMe, mapping attacks to layers to stay legal and ethical.

 Wrapping Up
Learning the OSI and TCP/IP models has been a game-changer for me. OSI gives me a clear way to think about networking, while TCP/IP shows how it actually works. Together, they’re like a map for spotting security gaps in ethical hacking. Next, I’m thinking of diving into scanning with tools like Nmap or exploring specific protocols in depth.
